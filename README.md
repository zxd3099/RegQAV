# RegQAV
This is the official repository for our MM 2025 paper "Query-Based Audio-Visual Temporal Forgery Localization with Register-Enhanced Representation Learning".
We are currently releasing a portion of the code, as this work is being further extended for a journal submission. The complete code and pretrained weights will be made available once the journal submission process is finalized.
